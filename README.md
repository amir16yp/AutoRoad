# AutoRoad
A bukkit/spigot/paper plugin for automatically creating paths and bridges
## New Features:
- Create randomized paths with the blocks you chose, this time its not limited to 3
- Can remove snow if it exists on the path you're making
- Can now set on what terrain you want your path on, it can even be air-useful for quickly building bridges (default is grass blocks and podzol)
