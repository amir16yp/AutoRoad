# AutoRoad
A bukkit/spigot/paper plugin for automatically creating paths and bridges
## New Features:
- Create randomized paths with the blocks you chose, this time its not limited to 3
- Can remove snow if it exists on the path you're marking
- Bridge mode- build the paths in the air
## Todo:
- Make a way to set the default blocks the path will be on, i.e something other than grass
